1. Overview
============================================================================

JayHorn is a verification based on Horn clauses for Java Programs. 
For the artifact evaluation we are only supplying the Jar file. 
The interested user can build JayHorn from sources (see Installation section). 

JayHorn supports two solver backends: 
- Eldarica (https://github.com/uuverifiers/eldarica) which is included and runs
as a default.
- Z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) which can be used via a flag but requires 
a bit of installation effort to get the JNI bindings running (see 2.3).


2. Installation
============================================================================

2.1 Prerequisites
---------------------
You can skip this section if you are using the VM image.

- Java 8:
    JayHorn is a tool written in Java. The demo requires a Java 8 Runtime
    Environment (JRE) to run, e.g., Oracle's (http://java.oracle.com/) or
    OpenJDK (http://openjdk.java.net/).

- (optional) Z3: If you want to use Z3 as the backend solver, you need the Z3 library.
  The Z3 native library are supplied with this artifact (e.g. native_lib).


2.2 Contents Overview
---------------------
This distribution contains the following files and directories:

- benchmarks/
    A set of Java programs

- jayhorn.jar
    The jayhorn jar file.

- native_lib/
  The Z3 native libraries.
   
- cav16-jayhorn.pdf
  The accepted CAV paper

- README
    This file.


2.3 Compiling from Source
-------------------------
This section is for interested readers only. It assumes that you have Gradle
and git (http://git-scm.com/) installed, and are using a Unix-like operating
system.

For compiling the complete project from source, follow
the following steps:

   git clone https://github.com/jayhorn/jayhorn
   cd jayhorn/jayhorn
   ./gradlew jar
   
The jayhorn jar file will be generated in build/libs. Note that in order to use Z3,
you need to do the following:

 - in Linux
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[JAYHORN_DIR]/jayhorn/native_lib

 - in OS X
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=[JAYHORN_DIR]/jayhorn/native_lib


2. Usage
============================================================================
 
  > java -jar jayhorn.jar [options] -j [JAR or Dir containing *.class]

  options:

     -solver [z3] // use Z3 instead of Eldarica (default solver)
  

 * Example

  To verify the program in benchmarks/assert1/assert1.java

  > java -jar jayhorn.jar -j benchmarks/assert1/

  To verify the same program using Z3. 

  > java -jar jayhorn.jar â€”solver z3 j benchmarks/assert1/
